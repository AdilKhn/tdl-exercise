- Clone this repo. This will give you the `lein` script in the current directory. Note: You must have java installed for this to work

- cd to the `./app` directory and run the command:


      ../lein spec -f d


  This will recurse through the directory and look for any tests to run. The template creates
  the first test which will fail. You are now ready to use TDD to learn clojure!
